## Statistics are not comparable
Using the data from 919 deceased retirees in the past 6 years, the email claims that World Bank retirees do not live as long as the average American population. At first glance, this claim seems plausible given the large work load and [frequent travel schedules](https://www.fastcompany.com/3050543/why-frequent-business-travel-is-so-bad-for-you) of most World Bank staff. However, the mean age of 81 years old that was calculated by the author includes the entire sample of all 919 deceased retirees when it should only include the retirees that survived to at least 65 years old. The statistics Social Security Administration that the the author uses as comparison only includes the population that has reached the age of 65. So to make the mean age of death for World Bank retirees comparable to the figures from the Social Security Administration, the author should have excluded retirees that did not reach the age of 65 when calculating the mean age. The mean age of death for World Bank retirees will be greater than 81 years old once those people are excluded.

Additionally, the referenced statistic from the Social Security Administration is disaggregated by sex because the life expectancy of women is higher than that of men. The author should have also calculated the mean age of death for the retirees separately for men and women to make it fully comparable to their referenced statistic. Additionally, disaggregating by sex would allow the author to observe any differences between the sexes in age of death between the general American population and World Bank retirees.

## Median versus mean
Looking at the distribution of the age of death for World Bank retirees in the graph provided, we can see that the distribution is skewed to the left. Given that the distribution is skewed, the author should also consider reporting the median instead of the mean, because the median is provides a more realistic measurement for retirees who obviously have already survived past youthful mortality and gives a better picture of how many years of life they have left. Furthermore, the mean is sensitive to outliers, such as the "hardy soul" that made it to 104 years old, so using the median would prevent any issues that would result from outliers.
